# 🔧 URGENT: HIERARCHY DEBUGGING - STEP BY STEP

## 🚨 Current Problem
From your screenshots, I can see:
- ✅ **Hierarchy EXISTS in database**: Akshay → Ashwani, Loveleen (User Management shows this)
- ❌ **API not working**: "All Assigned (0 users)" and "No team members found"
- ❌ **Team visibility broken**: Leads not showing subordinate assignments

## 🧪 IMMEDIATE TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Click the Debug Button
1. **Log in as Akshay (Team Leader)**
2. **Go to Lead Management**
3. **Look for the orange "Debug" button** next to Export/Import
4. **Click it** - this will run comprehensive tests

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for the debug output** starting with:
   - `🧪 USER LOOKUP TEST:`
   - `🔍 HIERARCHY DEBUG INFO:`

### Step 3: Share the Results
**Copy and paste the console output** - this will show me exactly what's wrong.

## 🔍 What the Debug Will Show

### Expected Good Results:
```
JWT User: akshay
Database Users: 15
User Found: YES
Method: byUsername
Subordinates: 2
Assignable Users: 3
```

### Possible Problems:
```
JWT User: admin
Database Users: 15
User Found: NO
Method: None worked
Subordinates: 0
Assignable Users: 0
```

## 🛠️ MANUAL DATABASE CHECK

If you want to check the database directly, run this in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Check Akshay's exact database record
SELECT 
    id, name, username, email, role, reports_to, status
FROM users 
WHERE name ILIKE '%akshay%' OR username ILIKE '%akshay%'
ORDER BY name;

-- Check who reports to Akshay
SELECT 
    s.name as subordinate_name,
    s.username as subordinate_username,
    s.role as subordinate_role,
    s.reports_to,
    m.name as manager_name
FROM users s
JOIN users m ON s.reports_to = m.id
WHERE m.name ILIKE '%akshay%' OR m.username ILIKE '%akshay%';
```

## 🎯 LIKELY ROOT CAUSES

Based on my analysis, the issue is probably one of these:

### 1. **JWT Username Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Login creates JWT with username "admin" but database has "akshay" 
- **Symptom**: User lookup fails, returns 0 assignable users
- **Fix**: Debug will show exact JWT vs DB username

### 2. **Case Sensitivity Issue**
- **Problem**: JWT has "Akshay" but database has "akshay"
- **Symptom**: User lookup fails on exact match
- **Fix**: My improved API now handles case-insensitive matching

### 3. **Email vs Username Login**
- **Problem**: User logs in with email but JWT stores different field
- **Symptom**: API can't find current user
- **Fix**: Debug will show which lookup method works

### 4. **Database Connection Issue**
- **Problem**: API can't connect to Supabase
- **Symptom**: All API calls fail
- **Fix**: Debug will show connection errors

## 🚀 QUICK FIXES TO TRY

### Fix 1: Clear Cache and Re-login
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Log out completely**
3. **Log back in as Akshay**
4. **Try the debug button again**

### Fix 2: Check Login Credentials
- **Try logging in with exact username from User Management**: `akshay`
- **Try logging in with full name**: `Akshay Suryanvanshi`
- **Try logging in with email**: `akshay@delhimedical.net`

### Fix 3: Check Network Tab
1. **Press F12 → Network tab**
2. **Clear network logs**
3. **Go to Lead Management**
4. **Look for failed API calls** (red entries)
5. **Click on `/assignable-users` call**
6. **Check the Response tab**

## 📋 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

Please run through this and share results:

- [ ] **Debug button clicked** - Console output copied
- [ ] **Current login credentials** - How are you logging in? (username/email)
- [ ] **Network tab checked** - Any failed API calls?
- [ ] **Database query run** - Akshay's record found?
- [ ] **Browser cache cleared** - Fresh login attempted?

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

Once you click the debug button and share the console output, I'll be able to:

1. **Identify the exact user lookup issue**
2. **Fix the JWT vs database matching**
3. **Ensure subordinate detection works**
4. **Get the multi-select dropdown populated**
5. **Fix the team workload display**

The hierarchy exists in your database - we just need to fix the API lookup logic!
