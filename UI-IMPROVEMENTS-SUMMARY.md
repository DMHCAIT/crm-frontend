## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

### For Debugging Assignable Users (Empty Dropdown):
1. **Click the orange "Debug" button** next to Export/Import
2. **Open browser console (F12)**  
3. **Look for detailed user lookup information**
4. **Share the console output** so I can fix the root cause

### The UI improvements are deployed and should work immediately!

The multi-select, scrolling, and clickable leads are all visual/interaction improvements that don't depend on the backend API issues.
