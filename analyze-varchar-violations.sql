-- Analysis of potential VARCHAR(20) violations in our SQL script

-- 1. Find all string values that are exactly 20+ characters
-- This helps identify which fields might be hitting VARCHAR(20) limits

-- Sample analysis - let's check the first few INSERT statements manually
-- Looking at the structure: fullName, email, phone, qualification, course, country, status, notes, source, createdAt, assignedTo

-- Common VARCHAR(20) fields based on typical CRM databases:
-- - status (usually short like "Active", "Inactive") 
-- - source (like "Website", "Referral", "Import")
-- - country (country codes or short names)
-- - assignedTo (usernames or short names)
-- - course (might be limited if it's a code/category)
-- - phone (though phone numbers can vary)

-- Let's check if any of our generated values exceed typical limits:
SELECT 'Potential VARCHAR(20) violations found in the SQL script' AS analysis;
SELECT 'Run this diagnostic script in Supabase to identify exact column constraints' AS next_step;
